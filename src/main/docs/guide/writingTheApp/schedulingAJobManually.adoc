Imagine the following scenario. You want to send every user an email 2 hours after they registered into your app. You want to ask him about his experiences during this first interaction with your application.

For this guide, we are going to schedule a Job to trigger after one minute.

To test it out, we are going to call twice a new use case named `RegisterUseCase` when the app starts.

Modify `Application`:

[source, java]
.src/main/java/example/micronaut/Application.java
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/java/example/micronaut/Application.java[]
----

<1> Annotate `Application.java` with `@Singleton` to register it in the application context.
<2> Listen to the event `ServerStartupEvent`
<3> Constructor injection of `RegisterUseCase`
<4> `onApplicationEvent` is invoked when the app starts.

&nbsp;

As you see in the previous example, subscribing to an event is as easy as implementing `ApplicationEventListener`.


Create a runnable task `EmailTask.java`

[source, java]
.src/main/java/example/micronaut/EmailTask.java
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/java/example/micronaut/EmailTask.java[]
----

Create `RegisterUseCase.java` which schedules the previous task.

[source, java]
.src/main/java/example/micronaut/RegisterUseCase.java
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/java/example/micronaut/RegisterUseCase.java[]
----

<1> Constructor injection of `EmailUseCase`
<2> Inject the `TaskScheduler` bean
<3> Create a `Runnable` task.
<4> Schedule the task to run a minute from now.

If you execute the above code you will see the Job being executed one minute after we schedule it and with the supplied email address.
